Apple Store Data Analysis Project

STAKEHOLDER: An aspiring app developer needs data-driven insights to decide what type of app to build

The stakeholder/client wants to answer the following questions:

1. What app categories are most popular?
2. What price should I set?
3. How can I maximize user ratings? 

DATASET
description of dataset (table, num of rows, etc.)

AppleStore.csv appleStore_description1.csv, appleStore_description2.csv, 
appleStore_description3.csv, appleStore_description4.csv, appleStore_description.csv


Exploratory data analysis (EDA) finding issues in the data set (missing/null values, errors, outliers etc.)



FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Paid apps have better ratings
This could be for a number of reasons:
	-User who pay for/have a subscriptiion to an apps are more likely to be a highly engaged user of that app
	-If the client/stakeholder perceives their app to be of high quality consider charging a fee for the app

2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings
	-Supporting a high quantity of languages isn't necessarily important; focus on your target audience to decide the right languages for your app. 

3. Finance and book are among the lowest rated apps
	-If you can create a high quality app in these categories that address user needs better than what is currently being offered there is potential for high user ratings and high market penetration

4. Apps with longer/more thorough descriptions have better ratings
	-Users prefer to know the uses and capabilities of an app prior to downloading it. A detailed, well-crafted app description could set clear expectations and increase user satisfaction

5. A new app should aim for an average raing above 3.5

6. Games and entertainment are among the highest rated app genres
	-The games and entertainment genres are highly competitive; there is likely to be a higher barrier to entry as the market is more saturated for these categories.
